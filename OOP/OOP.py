'''The initial values of the class variables are specified in a constructor
(constructor method)
its defined with 
def __init__(self):
in java for example the constructor has the same name of the class'''

'''To encapsulate a variable , so it is not accessible from outside the class
But it is still accessible from inside the class we use:
self.__wheels
inside the constructor 
'''

'''Encapsulate methods: Â¿Utility?
Maybe to check the integrity of the car before start the engine
To encapsualte a method we can use the same way: __internal_check(self)
'''
